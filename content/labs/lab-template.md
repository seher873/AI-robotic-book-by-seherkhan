# Example Lab Exercise: Introduction to Neural Networks

## Objective

In this lab, you will implement a simple neural network from scratch using Python and NumPy to better understand the fundamental concepts of forward and backward propagation.

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Module 1
- Basic understanding of linear algebra
- Python programming knowledge

## Setup

This lab uses a cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment. [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/...)

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the structure of a neural network
- Implement forward propagation
- Implement backward propagation
- Train a simple model

## Steps

1. Import required libraries (NumPy, matplotlib)
2. Load and preprocess sample data
3. Define the neural network architecture
4. Implement forward propagation function
5. Implement backward propagation function
6. Train the model
7. Visualize the results

## Datasets

- Sample 2D dataset for demonstration
- MNIST subset for practice

## Expected Output

After completing this lab, you should be able to:
- Explain the forward propagation process
- Understand how gradients are computed in backward propagation
- Train a simple neural network from scratch
